We will look at how a genetic algorithm can be used to find the minimum of a function and implement it in Python.


## Some definitions

A **genetic algorithm** is an optimisation heuristic inspired from the mechanism of Darwin's natural evolution. It leverages the process of natural selection to select individuals that are fittest to survive to the next generation.


- **Individual (= chromosome)**: one possible solution to the problem
- **Design parameters (= genes)**: the parameters to optimise. Each individual is defined by a list of its design parameters.
- **Population**: a group of individuals or designs to be optimised
- **Generation**: a population at a specific interation
- **Objective function (= fitness function)**: the function to minimise
- **Design space**: set of all the possible design parameters values
- **Objective space**: set of all the objective function value
- **Parents**: individuals belonging to an older generation
- **Offspring**: individual belonging to a younger generation
- **Crossover**: it consists in combining the genes of two parents to create an offspring.
- **Mutation**: it consists in altering a few genes of a parent to create an offspring.


In its most basic form, a genetic algorithm comprises the following stages:
1. Initialisation of the population
2. Selection of the best parents
3. Reproduction (by mutation and/or by crossover) to generate offsprings
4. Evaluation of the population
5. Termination according to criterion

## Implementation


We will implement a simple genetic algorithm in Python. The objective is to find the minimum of this objective function with 2 design parameters: $$Z(x, y) = x\sin(x)*y\cos(y)$$.
The source code can be found [here](https://github.com/PierreExeter/simple_GA).
