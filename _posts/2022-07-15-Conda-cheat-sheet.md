## Some definitions

**Conda** is an open source package manager tool and environment management system. It is mostly used for created isolated Python environments but it can package and distribute software for any language.

**Anaconda** is a free and open-source Python distribution for scientific computing. It includes conda and plus hundreds of popular Python packages such as numpy, scipy, matplotlib, pandas, etc...

**Miniconda** is a lighter alternative to Anaconda that just include conda and its dependencies but no Python packages.

A **virtual environment** is a named, isolated, working copy of Python that that maintains its own files, directories, and paths so that you can work with specific versions of libraries or Python itself without affecting other Python projects. Virtual environments make it easy to cleanly separate different projects and avoid problems with different dependencies and version requirements across components.


Please see the [official page](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html) for more information.

## Other environment managers



**virtualenv** is a tool to create isolated environments for Python only.


**venv** is a tool to create isolated environments for Python 3 only.
