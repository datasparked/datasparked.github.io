First things first, comments are most welcome and I value the time that visitors spend to share ideas and give feedback. Thank you to everyone who leave comments.

However, I also want the comments to be as useful as possible to all of readers. While keeping most comments, I will remove these:
- Harassing comments
- Anonymous comments
- Promotional comments
- Any comments deemed not appropriate

I reserve the right to remove any comments from the site; please leave comments that are respectful and useful.
