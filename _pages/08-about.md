Welcome to my blog! I conduct research on machine learning applied to engineering problems. In particular, I applied evolutionary algorithms, anomaly detection approaches and reinforcement learning to material engineering, manufacturing and robotics problems. In my spare time, I maintain and share machine learning-related content on this blog.
