## What is Docker?

[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is a tool used to deploy software across different platform without running into compatibility issues.

A Docker **image** is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application (code, libraries, settings, etc...).  On a Linux system, Docker images are stored in /var/lib/docker.

A running instance of an image is called a **container**. A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another.

## Cheat sheet

You can download a printable Linux command line cheat sheet [here]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/downloads/docker-cheat-sheet.pdf) from [Cheatography](https://cheatography.com/gambit/cheat-sheets/docker/).

- Check Docker installation

```bash
docker version
docker run hello-world
```

- List docker images

```bash
docker images
```

- List dangling Docker images

```bash
docker images -f dangling=true
```

- Remove dangling images and build caches, all stopped containers and all networks not used by at least 1 container (useful to free some space).

```bash
docker system prune
```

- Remove docker image by ID

```bash
docker rmi -f IMAGE_ID
```

- Download a Docker image

```bash
docker pull IMAGE_NAME
```

- List running containers

```bash
docker ps
docker container ls
```

- List all containers

```bash
docker ps -a
```

- Stop a container

```bash
docker stop CONTAINER_ID
```

- Remove a container

```bash
docker rm CONTAINER_ID
```

- Stop all the containers

```bash
docker stop $(docker ps -a -q)
```

- Remove all the containers

```bash
docker rm $(docker ps -a -q)
```

- Run a docker image

```bash
docker run -it --rm IMAGE_ID
```

- Options of the run command:

```bash
-u $(id -u):$(id -g)       # assign a user and a group ID
--gpus all                 # allow GPU support
-it                        # run an interactive container inside a terminal
--rm                        # automatically remove the container after exiting
--name my_container        # give it a friendly name
-v ~/docker_ws:/notebooks  # share a directory between the host and the container
-p 8888:8888               # define port 8888 to connect to the container (for Jupyter notebooks)
```

- Open a new terminal in a running container

```bash
docker exec -it CONTAINER_ID bash
```

## Create a new Docker image


There are 2 main methods.

#### Method 1 : Using a Dockerfile


1. Create a file called `Dockerfile` on your host machine.

    ```dockerfile
    # getting base Ubuntu image
    FROM ubuntu

    # file author / maintainer
    LABEL maintainer="your_email_address"

    # update the repository sources list
    RUN apt-get update

    # print Hello World
    CMD ["echo", "Hello World"]
    ```

2. Build the image.

    ```bash
    docker build -t myimage:0.1 .
    ```

3. Run the image.

    ```bash
    docker run myimage:0.1
    ```


#### Method 2 : Commit a Docker image from a running container


Modify a running container and run this in another terminal.


```bash
docker commit CONTAINER_ID my_new_image
```
